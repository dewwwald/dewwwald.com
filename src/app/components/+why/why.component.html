    I am a full stack web developer with an eye for beautiful design and rich interactive user interfaces. I have experience in software design patterns, a high level of technical experience in Javascript, various frameworks and Content Management Systems. My academic B.Sc degree in Computer Science and Information Technology provides a solid base for growth. I like taking ownership of my work and really enjoy working in a team environment. I am always eager to collaborate, learn new things and solve a problem over a cup of coffee.
